Incorporated last year, Telenor Health AS aims to develop a “digital front door to health”, that can be scaled to tens of millions of consumers across Telenor markets and beyond. The company has recently achieved several key milestones in preparation for launch in collaboration with Grameenphone.

“The work that GP have already done with healthcare services was a big part of our decision to make Bangladesh our first market,” notes Telenor Health chief executive officer Sajid Rahman. “It gives us an opportunity to prototype, test, and refine new features and services in the real world.”
